# Islandwar-exe
This project contains a downloadable .exe file of my game "Islandwar". To download the file, select "Islandwar.exe and click on "Download". 

# Why a sepereate repository?
It seems as if Windows prevents the download of a complete ZIP file due to safety reasons, if it contains an .exe file. This repository enables people without python installed to get a playable version, while other programmers can still download the whole (.exe free) code from my repository "Islandwar".
